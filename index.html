        <b>Emperor Nate --</b>
        Over the course of this debate both sides have seemingly reached a consensus: I am right and they are wrong. 
        <br><br>
        Sure, the opponent may still be so deluded that they actually think their case is against ours, but if you think about it, 
        their case supports ours. While their impacts about global warming and the economy are absolutely on point, they are mistaken 
        in thinking that those impacts belong to them. Those are our impacts. 
        <br><br>
        While the opposing team has managed to get their impacts across, they have not been able to do the same for their intelligence. 
        Listen, I am sure both of you are very gifted students, you have yet to show any parts of your brains which are not smooth. 
        Your links are non-existent, our evidence outweighs yours, and your arguments are simply idiotic. 
        <br><br>
        Yes, I get it, Debate is hard. However, wearing suits is not going to help your arguments. You should have spent less time worrying 
        about your tie and more time worrying about tying in your contentions to your impacts. While you're at it, perhaps you two should refrain 
        from pleasuring yourselves at the food court in the future? Those belts are looking quite tight.
        <br><br>
        In contrast to your parents’ divorce case, our Debate case is quite tight and orderly. I believe that I – I mean we – have sufficiently tied 
        raising the minimum wage to nuclear holocaust through our in depth analysis of CNN articles. If we raise the minimum wage, then it will cause 
        inflation – as in money getting less valuable – which will cause a second American Civil War that will let China invade Taiwan that will lead to nuclear war.
        <br><br>
        Furthermore, along with turning the Earth into a hellish wasteland devoid of life, nuclear armageddon will be really bad for climate change. It is certain that if 
        there are any cockroaches left after the blast and radiation, they will likely have to flee their cockroach homes due to environmental disasters. This will overwhelm 
        America’s already backed up immigration system. However, we do acknowledge that without food, in this scenario you would lose weight. However, the millions of dead 
        immigrants who will have to wait for years to enter the country matter way more than your eating habits.
        <br><br>
        Have I mentioned to either of you that your eyebrows look fucking disgusting? Honestly, it would be better if there was nothing there. If you want to get in contact 
        with a guy who can sort that out we can talk after this Debate.
        <br><br>
        In conclusion, we are right, and they are wrong. They simply don’t understand our arguments, or even their own arguments. Judge, for these reasons, you must affirm the 
        resolution that High school Public Forum Debate resolutions should not confront sensitive religious issues (Reddit, 13).

        R. “TIL that in November 2010, the PF debate resolution was "Resolved: An Islamic cultural center should be built near Ground Zero." This sparked enough controversy that the topic was changed to "Resolved: High school Public Forum Debate resolutions should not.” Reddit, r/TodayILearned, 2013.
